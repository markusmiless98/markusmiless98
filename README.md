## Hi there 👋

This is markusmiless98's github, generally known online by alias **Seventh**.

I've previous experience in:
- C#
- HTML
- CSS
- PHP
- Node.js
- Javascript
- LUA
- SQL
- GDscript

I've contributed to a few projects on my spare time, the most notable being:
- TGWR Mod for Hearts of Iron 4 (The Great War Redux)
- Anbennar Mod for Europa Universalis 4 (Note: My contribution on this project was in the first year or so of this project's release, and from what I can from files most of the work done has been majorily reworked since then)
- Chaddhaus Mod for Hearts of Iron 4 (now defunct multiplayer mod made for the purpose of use on the YouTuber's Alex the Rambler's discord server, it was also used for one tournament that was organised in part by Paradox Interactive in 2023)
